I suppose i need a mission statement for this thing :P

It's a lil car widget, where the firmware is derived from a previous car widget (carlcdp).
Previously the mission was to:
- display two voltages
- control a relay based on a voltage

Other things were bonus features, like the temperature display, clock and whatnot things

This device has a mission to take in data:
- RPM pulse
- speedometer pulse
- fuel sensor voltage
(other things too, but those are bonus)

and process it into features:
- odometer 
 - trip meter
- speedometer
- RPM display

- fuel level display 
 - longer-scale derived displays like l/100km

(again, other things too, but these are the primary ones)
